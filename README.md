### Price phone classification
This model uses 2 machine learning algorithms, namely KNN and Random Forest. Mobile phone prices are classified against 4 different labels.

#### What's next?
1. Explain how important each feature is to the target.
2. Adding several types of algorithms for comparison
3. Creating a deeper EDA 

#### Dataset Overview 
A collection of features characterizing mobile phones, including battery power, camera specifications, network support, memory, screen dimensions, and other attributes. The 'price_range' column categorizes phones into price ranges, making this dataset suitable for mobile phone classification and price prediction tasks.
